# TODO: AI Evaluation System Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT AIM & OBJECTIVE

### **What We're Building:**
A Farcaster flirting bot with a prize pool system that uses AI to evaluate user participation and select weekly winners. Users pay 0.01 USDC per cast mention, and the best cast (highest AI score) wins the accumulated prize pool.

### **Current Problem:**
- AI evaluation system is not implemented
- Contract stores too much data on-chain (expensive for 100+ users)
- No proper winner selection mechanism
- Missing event indexing for off-chain data storage

### **Our Solution:**
Implement a **cost-effective AI evaluation system** that:
1. **Stores minimal data on-chain** (just scores, not verbose text)
2. **Uses events for off-chain indexing** (cast content stored cheaply)
3. **Returns AI scores only** (0-50 range for easy comparison)
4. **Selects winners based on highest score**
5. **Scales to 100+ users** without breaking the bank

### **Technical Architecture:**
- **On-Chain:** Smart contract stores user participation + AI scores
- **Off-Chain:** Events emit cast content for database indexing
- **AI:** Grok AI evaluates casts and returns numerical scores
- **Winner Selection:** Highest score wins the weekly prize pool

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] AI can evaluate all weekly participations
- [ ] Winner selection works automatically
- [ ] System handles 100+ users cost-effectively
- [ ] Cast content is accessible for AI evaluation
- [ ] Frontend displays scores and winners clearly

  - [x] Add getCommonData function for frontend dashboard
  - [x] Remove redundant functions (getCurrentWeekParticipants, getUserConversations, getTopConversationsForEvaluation)
  - [x] Add proper access control for all admin functions
  - [x] Remove participation restriction - users can now send multiple casts per week
  - [x] Implement conversation-based AI evaluation system
  - [x] Add comprehensive error handling with custom errors
  - [x] Add pause/unpause and emergency withdraw functions
  - [x] Add proper event system for off-chain indexing

### âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Smart Contract is Production Ready!

  - [ ] Create API endpoint to listen to AIEvaluationCompleted events
  - [ ] Implement event parsing and storage logic
  - [ ] Add error handling and retry mechanisms for event indexing

  - [ ] Modify participateInCast call to include castContent parameter
  - [ ] Update contract interaction to emit CastParticipated event
  - [ ] Ensure proper castHash handling (no double hashing)

  - [ ] Deploy updated contract to testnet
  - [ ] Test participateInCast with event emission
  - [ ] Test recordAIScore function
  - [ ] Test getCurrentWeekParticipations function
  - [ ] Verify gas costs for 100+ users scenario

- [ ] Test AI evaluation flow

  - [ ] Test winner selection based on scores

- [ ] Test frontend integration
  - [ ] Test AI evaluation button functionality
  - [ ] Test score display and winner announcement
  - [ ] Test error handling and user feedback

## Phase 7: Documentation & Cleanup
