CURRENT STATUS
==============

WORKING COMPONENTS ‚úÖ
====================
1. Smart Contract: Fully deployed and verified on Base mainnet
2. Local API: All endpoints working perfectly
3. Bot Logic: Mention detection and response generation working
4. Environment Variables: All configured in Vercel
5. Local Build: All API routes building correctly

ISSUES IDENTIFIED ‚ùå
===================
1. Vercel Deployment: Only /api/health is being built and deployed
2. Other API routes (/api/bot/status, /api/bot/mention, /api/test) not appearing in Vercel build output
3. API routes returning 404 errors on deployed version

PENDING TASKS
=============

==========================
- Connect bot to smart contract for balance checks
- Implement cast payment processing
- Add prize pool distribution logic

4. GROK AI INTEGRATION ü§ñ
=========================
- Implement Grok AI for cast evaluation
- Add winner selection logic
- Integrate with weekly prize distribution

5. FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT üé®
==========================
- Create user interface for viewing prize pools
- Add wallet connection functionality
- Display user balance and participation history

6. TESTING & MONITORING üß™
==========================
- End-to-end testing of complete workflow
- Monitor webhook performance
